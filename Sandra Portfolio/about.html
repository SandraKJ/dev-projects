    <h1>The Next Programmer?</h1>
     <p> So who am I? The big question... Let me start off by introducing myself to everyone. I am a Polish woman, fluent in 3 languageswhich include my home language: Polish, English as well as Afrikaans.
         I am a wannabe programmer, specializing in Front-End Development. I got introduced
         to this whole new IT world about a few months ago and have been enjoying this journey thoroughly.
         I received my degree in International Relations from the well-known tertiary institution by the
         name of University of Pretoria, better known as Tuks. However, my newfound passion has been overridden by coding and constantly find myself working on different projects each day. </p>

    <p>&ldquo; I have missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I have lost almost 300 games. 26 times I have been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed &rdquo; &ndash; Michael Jordan</p>
