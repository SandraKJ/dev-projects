    <h1>The Programmer:</h1>
    <p>The world of a programmer is different than any other. This field has a little bit
       of everything. It includes not only coding, but engineering, design, SEO as well as
       analytical research, making this field one of the most hard-working, yet rewarding
       career. When a code works or does not, we may end up ripping our hair out, but at the
       end, we layout a perfectly coded website, making clients come back for more.

    <h2>The Programmer, Part 2:</h2>
    <p>We ensure that what we create matches users needs as well as preventing it from heading off into unsuitable directions. We have systems(step-by-step set of directions) that ensure we work accordingly to build maximum performance and increasingly enhance user interaction from all screen tops and sizes. Writing code that does not solve user problems is by definition a waste of time, but assembling odd bits of code in a user-driven manner is not actually better. Reacting to stuff is essentially the opposite of &ldquo;engineering&rdquo;. The later seeks to construct something that behaves precisely according to the builder's understanding. The former just randomly assembles stuff driven by an outside force.

    <h3>Motivation of a Programmer:</h3>
    <p>&ldquo;Take up one idea.Make that one idea your life-think of it, dream of it, live on that idea.Let the brain,muscles,nerves,every part of your body,be full of that idea,and just leave every other idea alone.This is the way to success&ldquo;.
